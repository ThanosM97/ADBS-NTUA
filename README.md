# Advanced Database Systems: Pyspark implementation of the k-means algorithm using HDFS
This repository hosts the programming exercise for the course Advanced Database Systems of NTUA ECE.

## About the project
The goal of this project was to implement the k-means clustering algorithm, using [Hadoop File System](https://hadoop.apache.org/) and [Pyspark](https://spark.apache.org/), in order to classify the pick-up locations of the [Yellow Taxi Trip Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2015-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/ba8s-jw6u) into five clusters and return the coordinates of their centroids.
